An implementation of the popular Bukkit/Spigot/Paper Modding API for FabricMC

Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bukkit
Prerelease builds: [CodeMC Jenkins](https://ci.codemc.io/job/Fungus-Software/job/Bukkit4Fabric)

## Credits
* [The Bukkit Project](https://bukkit.org/) for creating the Bukkit API
* [SpigotMC](https://spigotmc.org/) for maintaining the API past 1.8
* [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) for optimizing &amp; updating the API
* [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) for creating the modern mod loader
## Licence
The project is licenced under LGPL. The package ``org.bukkit.craftbukkit`` is not from CraftBukkit but contains our re-implemented classes to retain backwards compatibility with CraftBukkit/Spigot
## NMS Support
Currently we do not support CraftBukkit's ``net.minecraft.server`` classes.
This is planned to change at a future date.
