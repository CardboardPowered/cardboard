Cardboard is an implementation of the popular Bukkit/Spigot/Paper Modding API for FabricMC. This mod lets you use plugins that are made for Bukkit and it's derivatives (Spigot & Paper) on a Fabric modded server.

## License
We inherit the license from Paper. See [Paper's License](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for full details.
SrgLib is also licensed under MIT.

## NMS Support
We do support using Spigot's ``net.minecraft.server`` classes. 
Classes and Fields will automatically remap to their intermediary counterparts *(Including Reflection!)*
However, the current system is far from perfect and is currently being rewritten.

# Progress
There is a progress indicator in the Discord. Although, if you're not in the Discord:
Progress can be determined by the completeness of the to-do lists on the two pinned issues.
